I have seen and learned that Node.js is an open-source runtime environment built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine,
used primarily for server-side programming. It is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture,
which allows handling many simultaneous connections without waiting. Through my exploration,
I have learned that Node.js is especially useful for building scalable web applications,
particularly real-time, push-based services. I also learned about the advantages of Node.js,
such as its asynchronous nature, extensive npm ecosystem, and the ability to handle high concurrency.
Additionally, I have seen how to set up a basic HTTP server using Node.js,
and I practiced using Git and GitHub for version control and project submission.
