Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables server-side development using JavaScript. It’s fast, scalable, and event-driven, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps and web servers. It uses a non-blocking, asynchronous I/O model, allowing efficient handling of multiple requests. Node.js includes NPM (Node Package Manager) for managing libraries and dependencies. It’s cross-platform and commonly used with frameworks like Express.js for building web applications.
